# Payment Service API - Detailed Documentation
The Payment Service API enables seamless and secure payment processing through open banking. It provides a redirect URL for hosted payment processing, ensuring compliance with banking regulations and providing a streamlined user experience.

### API Playground:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="/payments/initiate">
    You can try the initiate payment endpoint [here](/api-reference/endpoint/paymentServices_initiate).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="/payments/status">
   You can try the retrieve transaction status endpoint [here](/api-reference/endpoint/paymentServices_status).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="/payments/challenge-deposit">
    You can try the challenge deposit endpoint [here](/api-reference/endpoint/paymentServices_challengeDeposit).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Key Features
- **Redirection Handling**: The returned redirect URL should not be embedded in an iframe or an embedded WebView. Instead, a proper browser redirect should be used.
- **Customization**: The payment page can be customized in terms of UI/UX, so redirection is not an issue.
- **Webhooks**: Webhooks can be called for by our service if required for more complex operations. You will be able to specify your webhook URL to us at the point when we onboard and set you up for the service. We can customize the flows and reduce the number of calls made to the API by enabling webhooks. Please speak to our specialists when signing up for the service so we can design the flow you require.

  To properly receive incoming webhooks, your server should provide an endpoint supporting:
  - **TLS encryption version 1.2**
  - **POST requests** that are either raw in `text/plain` if encrypted or `application/json` if no encryption is activated.

  You can use a service like [webhook.site](https://webhook.site/) to test receiving webhooks from your developer dashboard. For local testing, you can use a CLI tool such as `ngrok` to forward the requests to your local development server.

  When you receive an event, your endpoint should return an **HTTP 2xx status code** indicating that the event has been successfully received. Webhooks are automatically retried for up to **24 hours** if no HTTP 200 status code is returned. The call will also be considered failed if your endpoint doesn't respond within **10 seconds**.

  When a webhook call fails, we'll retry the call **6 more times**. By default, we wait:
  - **10 seconds** between the first and second attempt,
  - **100 seconds** between the third and the fourth,
  - **1000 seconds** between the fourth and the fifth,
  - **10000 seconds** for the last attempt.

- **Upcoming Features**: Future improvements include a rendered payment button, seamless/modal implementations, and native SDKs.
- **Regular Open Banking Payments and Challenge Deposits**: The API supports both regular open banking payments and **Challenge Deposits**, which include additional verification mechanisms such as **name matching**. These are handled through a dedicated endpoint described separately.

### Typical Payment Workflow
<Steps>
  <Step title="End-user completes purchase">
    The end-user completes a purchase and selects the **pay-by-bank** option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handling UI Interactions">
    The **merchant** (our customer) handles all UI interactions up to this point.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initiating Payment">
    The merchant sends a **payment initiation request** (`/payments/initiate`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirecting to Hosted Payment Page">
    A `redirectUrl` for the **Hosted Payment Page** is returned.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User completes payment">
    The user is redirected to the hosted page and completes the payment.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handling Redirect">
    Upon completion:
    - The user is **redirected back** to the merchant using the `returnUrl` specified in the request.
    - If no URL is provided, a message such as "You can now close this window." is displayed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Checking Payment Status">
    The merchant sends a **retrieve transaction status request** (`/payments/status`) to check the payment status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pending Status">
    If the status is still pending, all status queries will return a **PENDING** status.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Displaying Results">
    Based on the final status, the merchant can display the results to the user.
  </Step>
</Steps>
