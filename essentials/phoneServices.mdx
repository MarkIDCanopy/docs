## 3. Phone Risk Score (Upcoming)

### Endpoint
**POST** `/phoneRiskScore`

### Description

**Phone Risk Score** helps detect potentially fraudulent activity by analyzing the transaction risk associated with a phone number.

You send a phone number (optionally with an email and/or IP address), and the service evaluates static attributes and behavioral patterns to return a `risk.score`, a `risk.level`, and a `recommendation` — helping you decide whether to allow, flag, or block the transaction.

What’s evaluated:
- **Static attributes**: phone type, carrier, device ID, VPN/proxy usage, domains, etc.
- **Behavioral signals**: unusual usage patterns like high velocity or multiple locations/languages.

## Risk Recommendation Scales
Use the appropriate scale below for interpreting the risk recommendation provided to you, based on which version of Intelligence you used to make your request.

### Risk Score Table

| `risk.score` Range | Risk Level    | Recommendation | Comments                                                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-80               | low           | allow          | transaction with insufficient risk indicators<sup>*</sup>                                      |
| 81-450             | very-low      | allow          | transaction with significant confidence-building behavior on-network<sup>**</sup>             |
| 451-500            | medium-low    | flag           | suspicious transaction                                                                         |
| 501-600            | medium        | flag           | suspicious transaction                                                                         |
| 601-800            | high          | block          | risky transaction                                                                              |
| 801-1000           | very-high     | block          | risky transaction                                                                              |

<sup>*</sup> There isn't enough data yet to confirm that there is a high likelihood that the transaction belongs to a genuine user. However, the transaction also doesn't have any indicators that it is a suspicious or risky transaction.

<sup>**</sup> The transaction is assigned the "very-low" risk level because it has enough activity to suggest it likely does belong to a genuine user. This activity means there's more data to use as the basis for the `risk.score`.

### Reason Codes

These reason codes provide an **overall risk assessment** for a transaction, based on a combination of weighted trust and risk signals.

| Code   | Name                          | Meaning                                                                                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10010 | low activity                  | Not enough activity or attributes to classify the transaction as either risky or trustworthy. |
| 10020 | low regular activity          | Trustworthy category, based on past behavior.                                             |
| 10021 | regular activity              | Most trustworthy category, based on past behavior.                                        |
| 10030 | low-risk irregular activity   | Risky category, based on past behavior.                                                   |
| 10031 | medium-risk irregular activity | High-risk category, based on past behavior.                                               |
| 10032 | high-risk irregular activity  | Highest-risk category, based on past behavior.                                            |
| 10040 | irregular number type         | This number has risky static attributes (e.g., VOIP phone type or being on a blocklist).  |

#### A2P
Reason codes specific to application-to-person messaging (a2p).

### 4.2 Verification Match

### Endpoint
**PATCH** `/verificationMatch/{referenceId}`

### Description
Use this endpoint to validate the one-time passcode (OTP) provided by the end user and update the state of an active verification process.
This action is typically used to finalize a verification by checking whether the user-entered OTP matches the one originally sent via SMS or email.

If the OTP is correct, the verification process is marked as VERIFIED. If incorrect, an error is returned and the process may remain ONGOING, FAILED, or another relevant state depending on implementation.
