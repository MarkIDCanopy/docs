## 3. Phone Risk Score 

### Endpoint
**POST** `/phone-service/phoneRiskScore`

### Description

**Phone Risk Score** helps detect potentially fraudulent activity by analyzing the transaction risk associated with a phone number.

You send a phone number (optionally with an email and/or IP address), and the service evaluates static attributes and behavioral patterns to return a `risk.score`, a `risk.level`, and a `recommendation` — helping you decide whether to allow, flag, or block the transaction.

What’s evaluated:
- **Static attributes**: phone type, carrier, device ID, VPN/proxy usage, domains, etc.
- **Behavioral signals**: unusual usage patterns like high velocity or multiple locations/languages.

## Risk Recommendation Scales
Use the appropriate scale below for interpreting the risk recommendation provided to you, based on which version of Intelligence you used to make your request.

### Risk Score Table

| `risk.score` Range | Risk Level    | Recommendation | Comments                                                                                       |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0-80               | low           | allow          | transaction with insufficient risk indicators<sup>*</sup>                                      |
| 81-450             | very-low      | allow          | transaction with significant confidence-building behavior on-network<sup>**</sup>             |
| 451-500            | medium-low    | flag           | suspicious transaction                                                                         |
| 501-600            | medium        | flag           | suspicious transaction                                                                         |
| 601-800            | high          | block          | risky transaction                                                                              |
| 801-1000           | very-high     | block          | risky transaction                                                                              |

<sup>*</sup> There isn't enough data yet to confirm that there is a high likelihood that the transaction belongs to a genuine user. However, the transaction also doesn't have any indicators that it is a suspicious or risky transaction.

<sup>**</sup> The transaction is assigned the "very-low" risk level because it has enough activity to suggest it likely does belong to a genuine user. This activity means there's more data to use as the basis for the `risk.score`.

### Reason Codes

These reason codes provide an **overall risk assessment** for a transaction, based on a combination of weighted trust and risk signals.

| Code   | Name                          | Meaning                                                                                   |
|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 10010 | low activity                  | Not enough activity or attributes to classify the transaction as either risky or trustworthy. |
| 10020 | low regular activity          | Trustworthy category, based on past behavior.                                             |
| 10021 | regular activity              | Most trustworthy category, based on past behavior.                                        |
| 10030 | low-risk irregular activity   | Risky category, based on past behavior.                                                   |
| 10031 | medium-risk irregular activity | High-risk category, based on past behavior.                                               |
| 10032 | high-risk irregular activity  | Highest-risk category, based on past behavior.                                            |
| 10040 | irregular number type         | This number has risky static attributes (e.g., VOIP phone type or being on a blocklist).  |

#### A2P
Reason codes specific to application-to-person messaging (a2p).
